= class XMLRPC::BasicServer < Object

Is the base class for all XML-RPC server-types (CGI, standalone).
You can add handler and set a default handler.
Do not use this server, as this is/should be an abstract class.

=== How the method to call is found

The arity (number of accepted arguments) of a handler (method or Proc object) is
compared to the given arguments submitted by the client for a RPC ((-Remote Procedure Call-)).
A handler is only called if it accepts the number of arguments, otherwise the search
for another handler will go on. When at the end no handler was found,
the [[m:XMLRPC::BasicServer#set_default_handler]] will be called.
With this technique it is possible to do overloading by number of parameters, but
only for Proc handler, because you cannot define two methods of the same name in
the same class.


== Class Methods
--- new( class_delim="." )

Creates a new XMLRPC::BasicServer instance, which should not be
done, because XMLRPC::BasicServer is an abstract class. This
method should be called from a subclass indirectly by a super call
in the method initialize. The paramter class_delim is used
in [[m:XMLRPC::BasicServer#add_handler]] when an object is
added as handler, to delimit the object-prefix and the method-name.

== Instance Methods
--- add_handler( name, signature=nil, help=nil ) { aBlock }

Adds aBlock to the list of handlers, with name as the name of the method.
Parameters signature and help are used by the Introspection method if specified,
where signature is either an Array containing strings each representing a type of it's
signature (the first is the return value) or an Array of Arrays if the method has multiple
signatures. Value type-names are "int, boolean, double, string, dateTime.iso8601, base64, array, struct".

Parameter help is a String with informations about how to call this method etc.

A handler method or code-block can return the types listed at
[[m:XMLRPC::Client#call]].
When a method fails, it can tell it the client by throwing an
XMLRPC::FaultException like in this example:
    require "xmlrpc/server"

    s.add_handler("michael.div") do |a,b|
      if b == 0
        raise XMLRPC::FaultException.new(1, "division by zero")
      else
        a / b
      end
    end
The client gets in the case of b==0 an object back of type
XMLRPC::FaultException that has a faultCode and faultString
field.

--- add_handler( prefix, obj )
This is the second form of [[m:XMLRPC::BasicServer#add_handler]].
To add an object write:
    server.add_handler("michael", MyHandlerClass.new)
All public methods of MyHandlerClass are accessible to
the XML-RPC clients by (('michael."name of method"')). This is
where the class_delim in [[m:XMLRPC::BasicServer.new]]
has it's role, a XML-RPC method-name is defined by
prefix + class_delim + (('"name of method"')).

--- add_handler( interface, obj )
This is the third form of [[m:XMLRPC::BasicServer#add_handler]].

Use XMLRPC::interface to generate an ServiceInterface object, which
represents an interface (with signature and help text) for a handler class.

Parameter interface must be of type XMLRPC::ServiceInterface.
Adds all methods of obj which are defined in interface to the
server.

This is the recommended way of adding services to a server!


--- get_default_handler
Returns the default-handler, which is called when no handler for
a method-name is found.
It is a Proc object or nil.

--- set_default_handler ( &handler )
Sets handler as the default-handler, which is called when
no handler for a method-name is found. handler is a code-block.
The default-handler is called with the (XML-RPC) method-name as first argument, and
the other arguments are the parameters given by the client-call.

If no block is specified the default of XMLRPC::BasicServer is used, which raises a
XMLRPC::FaultException saying "method missing".


--- set_writer( writer )
Sets the XML writer to use for generating XML output.
Should be an instance of a class from module XMLRPC::XMLWriter.
If this method is not called, then XMLRPC::Config::DEFAULT_WRITER is used.

--- set_parser( parser )
Sets the XML parser to use for parsing XML documents.
Should be an instance of a class from module XMLRPC::XMLParser.
If this method is not called, then XMLRPC::Config::DEFAULT_PARSER is used.

--- add_introspection
Adds the introspection handlers "system.listMethods", "system.methodSignature" and "system.methodHelp",
where only the first one works.

--- add_multicall
Adds the multi-call handler "system.multicall".

--- get_service_hook
Returns the service-hook, which is called on each service request (RPC) unless it's nil.

--- set_service_hook ( &handler )
A service-hook is called for each service request (RPC).
You can use a service-hook for example to wrap existing methods and catch exceptions of them or
convert values to values recognized by XMLRPC. You can disable it by passing nil as parameter
handler .

The service-hook is called with a Proc object and with the parameters for this Proc.
An example:

   server.set_service_hook {|obj, *args|
     begin
       ret = obj.call(*args)  # call the original service-method
       # could convert the return value
     resuce
       # rescue exceptions
     end
   }
