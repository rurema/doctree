= class XMLRPC::Client < Object

Class XMLRPC::Client provides remote procedure calls to a XML-RPC server.

After setting the connection-parameters with [[m:XMLRPC::Client.new]] which
creates a new XMLRPC::Client instance, you can execute a remote procedure
by sending the [[m:XMLRPC::Client#call]] or [[m:XMLRPC::Client#call2]]
message to this new instance. The given parameters indicate which method to
call on the remote-side and of course the parameters for the remote procedure.

    require "xmlrpc/client"

    server = XMLRPC::Client.new("www.ruby-lang.org", "/RPC2", 80)
    begin
      param = server.call("michael.add", 4, 5)
      puts "4 + 5 = #{param}"
    rescue XMLRPC::FaultException => e
      puts "Error:"
      puts e.faultCode
      puts e.faultString
    end

or

    require "xmlrpc/client"

    server = XMLRPC::Client.new("www.ruby-lang.org", "/RPC2", 80)
    ok, param = server.call2("michael.add", 4, 5)
    if ok then
      puts "4 + 5 = #{param}"
    else
      puts "Error:"
      puts param.faultCode
      puts param.faultString
    end


== Class Methods
--- new( host=nil, path=nil, port=nil, proxy_host=nil, proxy_port=nil, user=nil, password=nil, use_ssl=false, timeout =nil)
Creates an object which represents the remote XML-RPC server on the
given host host. If the server is CGI-based, path is the
path to the CGI-script, which will be called, otherwise (in the
case of a standalone server) path should be "/RPC2".
port is the port on which the XML-RPC server listens.
If proxy_host is given, then a proxy server listening at
proxy_host is used. proxy_port is the port of the
proxy server.

Default values for host, path and port are 'localhost', '/RPC2' and
'80' respectively using SSL '443'.

If user and password are given, each time a request is send,
a Authorization header is send. Currently only Basic Authentification is
implemented no Digest.

If use_ssl is set to true, comunication over SSL is enabled.
Note, that you need the SSL package from RAA installed.

Parameter timeout is the time to wait for a XML-RPC response, defaults to 30.

--- new2( uri, proxy=nil, timeout=nil)
--- new_from_uri( uri, proxy=nil, timeout=nil)

:   uri
  URI specifying protocol (http or https), host, port, path, user and password.
  Example: https://user:password@host:port/path
:   proxy
  Is of the form "host:port".
:   timeout
  Defaults to 30.

--- new3( hash={} )
--- new_from_hash( hash={} )

Parameter hash has following case-insensitive keys:
 * host
 * path
 * port
 * proxy_host
 * proxy_port
 * user
 * password
 * use_ssl
 * timeout

Calls [[m:XMLRPC::Client.new]] with the corresponding values.

== Instance Methods
--- call( method, *args )

Invokes the method named method with the parameters given by
args on the XML-RPC server.
The parameter method is converted into a String and should
be a valid XML-RPC method-name.
Each parameter of args must be of one of the following types,
where Hash, Struct and Array can contain any of these listed ((:types:)):
    * Fixnum, Bignum
    * TrueClass, FalseClass (true, false)
    * String, Symbol
    * Float
    * Hash, Struct
    * Array
    * Date, Time, XMLRPC::DateTime
    * XMLRPC::Base64
    * A Ruby object which class includes XMLRPC::Marshallable (only if Config::ENABLE_MARSHALLABLE is true).
      That object is converted into a hash, with one additional key/value pair "___class___" which contains the class name
      for restoring later that object.

The method returns the return-value from the RPC
((-stands for Remote Procedure Call-)).
The type of the return-value is one of the above shown,
only that a Bignum is only allowed when it fits in 32-bit and
that a XML-RPC (('dateTime.iso8601')) type is always returned as
a [[c:XMLRPC::DateTime]] object and
a Struct is never returned, only a Hash, the same for a Symbol, where
always a String is returned.
A XMLRPC::Base64 is returned as a String from xmlrpc4r version 1.6.1 on.

If the remote procedure returned a fault-structure, then a
XMLRPC::FaultException exception is raised, which has two accessor-methods
faultCode and faultString of type Integer and String.

--- call2( method, *args )

The difference between this method and [[m:XMLRPC::Client#call]] is, that
this method do ((*not*)) raise a XMLRPC::FaultException exception.
The method returns an array of two values. The first value indicates if
the second value is a return-value (true) or an object of type
XMLRPC::FaultException.
Both are explained in [[m:XMLRPC::Client#call]].

Simple to remember: The "2" in "call2" denotes the number of values it returns.

--- multicall( *methods )

You can use this method to execute several methods on a XMLRPC server which supports
the multi-call extension.
Example:

  s.multicall(
    ['michael.add', 3, 4],
    ['michael.sub', 4, 5]
  )
  # => [7, -1]

--- multicall2( *methods )
Same as [[m:XMLRPC::Client#multicall]], but returns like [[m:XMLRPC::Client#call2]] two parameters
instead of raising an XMLRPC::FaultException.

--- proxy( prefix, *args )

Returns an object of class XMLRPC::Client::Proxy, initialized with
prefix and args. A proxy object returned by this method behaves
like [[m:XMLRPC::Client#call]], i.e. a call on that object will raise a
XMLRPC::FaultException when a fault-structure is returned by that call.

--- proxy2( prefix, *args )

Almost the same like [[m:XMLRPC::Client#proxy]] only that a call on the returned
XMLRPC::Client::Proxy object behaves like [[m:XMLRPC::Client#call2]], i.e.
a call on that object will return two parameters.

--- call_async(...)
--- call2_async(...)
--- multicall_async(...)
--- multicall2_async(...)
--- proxy_async(...)
--- proxy2_async(...)

In contrast to corresponding methods without "_async", these can be
called concurrently and use for each request a new connection, where the
non-asynchronous counterparts use connection-alive (one connection for all requests)
if possible.

Note, that you have to use Threads to call these methods concurrently.
The following example calls two methods concurrently:

  Thread.new {
    p client.call_async("michael.add", 4, 5)
  }

  Thread.new {
    p client.call_async("michael.div", 7, 9)
  }


--- timeout
--- user
--- password

Return the corresponding attributes.

--- timeout=()
--- user=()
--- password=()

Set the corresponding attributes.


--- set_writer( writer )

Sets the XML writer to use for generating XML output.
Should be an instance of a class from module XMLRPC::XMLWriter.
If this method is not called, then XMLRPC::Config::DEFAULT_WRITER is used.

--- set_parser( parser )

Sets the XML parser to use for parsing XML documents.
Should be an instance of a class from module XMLRPC::XMLParser.
If this method is not called, then XMLRPC::Config::DEFAULT_PARSER is used.

--- cookie
--- cookie=()

Get and set the HTTP Cookie header.

--- http_header_extra=()

Set extra HTTP headers that are included in the request.

--- http_header_extra

Access the via [[m:XMLRPC::Client#http_header_extra=]] assigned header.

--- http_last_response

Returns the Net::HTTPResponse object of the last RPC.
