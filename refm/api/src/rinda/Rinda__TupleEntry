A TupleEntry is a Tuple (i.e. a possible entry in some Tuplespace)
together with expiry and cancellation data.

== Class Methods

--- new(ary, sec = nil)
#@todo

Creates a TupleEntry based on +ary+ with an optional renewer or
expiry time +sec+.

A renewer must implement the +renew+ method which returns a
Numeric, nil, or true to indicate when the tuple has expired.

--- canceled?

--- expired?
#@todo

Has this tuple expired? (true/false).

A tuple has expired when its expiry timer based on the sec argument
