= class DRb::DRbObject < Object
alias DRbObject

Object wrapping a reference to a remote drb object.

Method calls on this object are relayed to the remote object 
that this object is a stub for.

== Class Methods
#@# bc-rdoc: detected missing name: _load
--- _load(s)
#@todo

Unmarshall a marshalled DRbObject.

If the referenced object is located within the local server,
then the object itself is returned. Otherwise, a new DRbObject
is created to act as a stub for the remote referenced object.

#@# bc-rdoc: detected missing name: new
--- new(obj, uri=nil)
#@todo

Create a new remote object stub.

obj is the (local) object we want to create a stub for. Normally
this is nil. uri is the URI of the remote object that this will
be a stub for.

#@# bc-rdoc: detected missing name: new_with_uri
--- new_with_uri(uri)
#@todo

Create a new DRbObject from a URI alone.

== Instance Methods

#@# bc-rdoc: detected missing name: method_missing
--- method_missing(msg_id, *a, &b)
#@todo

Routes method calls to the referenced object.

--- ==(other)
--- eql?(other)
#@todo

[[c:DRb::DRbObject]] オブジェクト同士の同値判定は、
オブジェクトが参照している URI と識別子が等しいかどうかでします。

--- __drburi 
#@todo

Get the URI of the remote object.

--- __drbref
#@todo

Get the reference of the object, if local.
